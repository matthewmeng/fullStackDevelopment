1. Creating and nesting components
    1. What's component?
    A component is a piece of the UI that has its own logic and appearance(a button or an entire page)
    /*
    function MyButton() {
      return (
        <button>I'm a button</button>
      );
    }

    export default function MyApp(){
        return (
            <div>
                <h1> Welcome to my app</h1>
                <MyButton/>
            </div>

       );
    }
    */

    React component names must always start with a capital letter, while HTML tags must be lowercase.

    2.Why do we need " import React from 'react' " in each file?
    JSX syntax used in the component needs to be transpiled into JavaScript code that can be understood
    by the browser.
    React library provides methods like 'React.createElement()' to achieve this transformation.
    So we need to import 'React' so that JSX can be transpiled correctly.

    * What is JSX?
    JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that lets us write HTML-like markup inside a JavaScript file
    The Web has been built on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. For many years, web developers kept content in HTML, design in
    CSS, and logic in JavaScript -- often in separate files
    But as the Web became more interactive, logic increasingly determined content. JavaScript was in charge of the HTML!
    This is why in React, rendering logic and markup live together in the same place -- components.
    (JSX is a syntax extension, while React is a JavaScript library.)

    The Rules of JSX:
        a. Return a single root element.
        because JSX is transformed into plain JavaScript objects. We can't return 2 objects from a function without wrapping
        them into an array.
        We need to use <></>
        b. Close all the tags
        c. camelCase most of the things!
        JavaScript has limitations on variable names. i.e. their names can't contain dashes or be reserved words like class.

    3.Why do we need 'export default XXX' XXX is the component;
    it is used to export the 'XXX' component in other files within our project. When we 'import' a component
    from another file, we usually use the 'export default' syntax to export it. This syntax allows us to import the
    component using any name we want in teh importing file.

    Using 'export default' allows us to have a simpler import statement and makes our code easier to read and maintain.
    or we need to:
    /*
    export {abc} in XXX.js;

    import {abc} from './XXX'; in App.js
    */

    now we could only:
    /*
    import xxx from './XXX';
    */

    3. Writing markup with JSX
    JSX is stricter than HTML. we have to close tags like <br />. Our component also can't return multiple JSX tags.
    We have to wrap them into a shared parent, like a <div> ... </div> or an empty <>...<> wrapper.
    like:
    /*
    function AboutPage() {
      return (
        <>
          <h1>About</h1>
          <p>Hello there.<br />How do you do?</p>
        </>
      );
    }
    */
    Online converter can be found to trans HTML to JSX.

    4.Adding styles
    In React, we specify a CSS class with className, which works the same way as the HTML class attribute:
    <img className="avatar" />
    Then we could write the CSS rule for it in a separate CSS file:
    .avatar{
        border-radius: 50%;
    }

    5.Displaying data
    JSX lets us put markup into JavaScript.
    When we want to add a little JavaScript logic or reference a dynamic property inside that markup. In this situation,
    we can use curly braces in our JSX to open a window to JavaScript.
    i.e. to display user.name:
    /*
    return(
        <h1>
            {user.name}
        </h1>
    );
    */

    using curly braces instead of quotes to "escape into JavaScript":
    const user = {
        name:Mike, id:3, imageUrl:aurl.com.au
    };
    return(
        <img
            className="avatar"
            src={user.imageUrl}
        />
    );
    *Where to use curly braces
    We can only use curly braces in two ways inside JSX:
    1. As text directly inside a JSX tag: <h1>{name}'s To Do List</h1> works.
    2. As attributes immediately following the = sign: src={avatar} will read the avatar variable, but src='{avatar}' will
    pass the string "{avatar}".

    "double curlies"
    We could also pass objects in JSX. Objects are also denoted with curly braces, like{name:"Hedy Lamarr", inventions:5}.
    Therefore, to pass a JS object in JSX, we must wrap the object in another pair of curly braces: person={{name:"Hedy Lamarr"
    , inventions: 5}}. inline CSS styles is an example (Inline style properties are written in camelCase).

    5.Conditional rendering
    except original if statement,
    we can use: conditional?operator
    if we don't need the else branch, we can also use a shorter logical && syntax:
    like:
    /*
    <div>
        (isLoggedIn && <AdminPanel />}
    </div>
    */

    6.Rendering lists
    rely on JavaScript features like for loop and the array map() function to render lists of components.
    like:
    /*
    const products = [
        {title: 'A', id:1},
        {title: 'B', id:2},
        {title: 'C', id:3}
    ];

    const listItems = products.map(product =>
        <li key={product.id}>
            {product.title}
        </li>
    );

    return(
        <ul>{listItems}</ul>
    )
    */

    7.Responding to events
    We can respond to events by declaring event handler functions inside our components:
    /*
    function MyButton(){
        function handleClick(){
            alert('Button is clicked');
        }

        return(
           <button onClick={handleClick}>
             Click it
           </button>
        );
    }
    */

    8.Updating the screen
    state-when we want our component to "remember" some information and display it.
    like:
    1st import useState from React:
    /*
        import {useState} from 'react';
    */
    2nd declare a state variable inside our component:
    /*
    function MyButton(){
        const [count,setCount] = useState(0);
    }
    */
    3nd we will get 2 things from useState: the current state(count), and the function that lets our update it (setCount).
    We can give them any names, like [something, setSomething].
    The 1st time the button is displayed, count will be 0 because we passed 0 to useState(). When we want to change state,
    call setCount() and pass the new value to it. Clicking the button will increment the counter:
    /*
    function MyButton(){
        const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

        function handleClick() {
            setCount(count + 1);
        }

        return (
            <button onClick={handleClick}>
                Clicked {count} times
            </button>
        )
    }
    */

    9.What is Props
    a shorthand for "properties", which are a way of passing data from parent to child components.
    Used to customize and configure React components, allowing us to make our components dynamic and reusable.
        a. Passing Data
        b. Immutable
        c. Customization:
        d. Component Composition.

    10.Using Hooks
    Functions starting with use are called Hooks.
    useState is a built-in Hook provided by React.
    Hooks are more restrictive than other functions.
    We can only call Hooks at the top of our components (or other Hooks).
    if we want to use useState in a condition or a loop, extract a new component and put it there.

    11.Keeping components pure
    A pure function:
    * Minds its own business. It does not change any objects or variables that existed before it was called.
    * Same inputs, same output. Given the same inputs , a pure function should always return the same result.
